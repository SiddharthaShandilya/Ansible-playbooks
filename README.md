ðŸ“Œ Train model to detect a face

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

ðŸ‘‰ Here is a simple demo of the working model

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

ðŸ“Œ The next step is to launch ec2-instance and and send what'a app message when a face is recognized.

ðŸ‘‰ I have used terraform to access and launch an ec2-instance.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________

ðŸ“Œ After your ec2-instance is launched the code will send a message to your what's-app

# Installation


[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Install git (preferably, version >= 2.0) and python (preferably, version >=3.6)
 [(windows)](https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-git-bash-on-windows/)
 For Linux :
 ```bash
    sudo yum instal git -y
    sudo yum install python -y
 ```
 
2. Copy the github url from the repository : 

 ```bash
 https://github.com/SiddharthaShandilya/Face_recognition_task_EC2-What-sAPP.git
 ```

3. Select a Directory in local system and use 

  ```bash 
  git clone https://github.com/SiddharthaShandilya/Face_recognition_task_EC2-What-sAPP.git           
  ```

    *Note for `git clone command`  Please make sure that you have proper internet connection. *

    *Note for `python` Please try to anaconda for running the app.*  

4. Create a seperate virtual environment to avoid conflict between python libraries :
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv new-env 
    ```

5. Activate the virtual env: ðŸ‘‰ [(click Here)](https://www.programshelp.com/help/python/activate_virtual_environment_python_windows_10.html)
6. Install all the libraries for the application.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Have a look at [Recommended configurations](#recommended-configurations) and [Custom configurations](#custom-configurations).

# Recommended configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!--

1. To add some short command (say, `lc`) with some flag options (say, `-l`, `-A`, `--sd`) by default, add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) :
    ```sh
    alias lc='colorls -lA --sd'
    ```

2. For changing the icon(s) to other unicode icons of choice (select icons from [here](https://nerdfonts.com/)), change the YAML files in a text editor of your choice (say, `subl`)

    ```sh
    subl $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml
    ```

</br></br>
-->

# Custom configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!--
You can overwrite the existing icons and colors mapping by copying the yaml files from `$(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml` into `~/.config/colorls`, and changing them.

- To overwrite color mapping :

  Please have a look at the [list of supported color names](https://github.com/sickill/rainbow#color-list). You may also use a color hex code as long as it is quoted within the YAML file and prefaced with a `#` symbol.

  Let's say that you're using the dark color scheme and would like to change the color of untracked file (`??`) in the `--git-status` flag to yellow. Copy the defaut `dark_colors.yaml` and change it.

  ```sh
  cp $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml/dark_colors.yaml ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml
  ```

  In the `~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml` file, change the color set for `untracked` from `darkorange` to `yellow`, and save the change.

  ```
  untracked: yellow
  ```

  Or, using hex color codes:

  ```
  untracked: '#FFFF00'
  ```

- To overwrite icon mapping :

  Please have a look at the [list of supported icons](https://nerdfonts.com/). Let's say you want to add an icon for swift files. Copy the default `files.yaml` and change it.

  ```sh
  cp $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml/files.yaml ~/.config/colorls/files.yaml`
  ```

  In the `~/.config/colorls/files.yaml` file, add a new icon / change an existing icon, and save the change.


  ```
  swift: "\uF179"
  ```
